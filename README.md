Description
-----------
The aim of the project is to implement an algorithm for self-reconstruction of digital images using fractal coding. Self-reconstruction (called self-recovery or self-embedding) allows you to verify the integrity of the images and to reconstruct the original content based on the digital watermark. Application developed in the project must be equipped with a graphical user interface that allows you to adjust the algorithm parameters and to protect and verify the integrity of digital images.

Functionalities
---------------
- PGM files: authentication , damage recognition and recovery

Dependencies
------------
- NumPy [link](http://www.numpy.org/)
- SciPy [link](http://www.scipy.org/)
